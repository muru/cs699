# This scipt will use curl (assuming it's somehwhere in your $PATH) to download
# a file in pieces of 149 MB, or whatever size you specify (in MB). 
# Unfortunately, there's not much support for arguments and switches to the 
# script. The currently fixed order is (with default values):
#  <target URL> [target directory = $PWD] [piece size in MB = 149]
# The intermediate pieces are stored in adirectory named ".tempdir" in the 
# target directory, with the part number (starting from 0) appended to it.
# It so happens that the script will try to resume download using any ".0" part
# in that directory, since my string manipulation isn't that good. Sorry!
# You may modify it as you please, so long as you tell me what you did, so that
# I can make use of any improvements you made. :) Happy downloading!
