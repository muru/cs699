The files linked to in resources are not included in the archive, 
to limit the size of the archive.

The site has been tested in Firefox 22.0 (Desktop), Chrome 28.0 
(Desktop), Chrome 28.0 (Android 4.3), Firefox 22.0 (Android 4.3), 
Opera Mini 7.5 (Android 4.3). Opera Mini faired well, but missed
a few steps. Probably won't work well in IE < 9.

The weird font sizes on Chrome and Firefox on Android are due to
font boosting. I'll keep it enabled because it does vastly improve
legibility, and also fits the page (horizontally) within the screen.
To disable it, add this meta tag to the head element in each page:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

17. Styles in style tag - not done (only acad.html needed 
                                    a specific style, and I 
                                    moved that to styles/acad.css.)
18. Separate CSS file - all pages via style.css, 
                        acad.html via styles/acad.html.
