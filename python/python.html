<h2>Python Exercises</h2>

<p>Python is excellent for text processing and functional programming,
as we'll find out in the course of these exercises.  Many exercises
will use the following (imagined) context.</p>

<p><b>The Job Interview</b></p>

<p>Anaconda Systems was one of the companies which came for placement
to IITB.  Their selection process included five written tests followed
by an interview.  The written tests had up to 5 marks each.  Students
could decide not to attempt a written test, since if they get the
written test totally wrong, they may get negative marks.</p>

<p>The file marks.ods gives the spreadsheet of marks obtained by each
of the candidates who appeared for selection.  There are some heading
rows in the spreadsheet.  The first row before the actual data in the
spreadsheet gives the column names which stand for the various written
tests.  In the cells, a "NA" means that the candidate did not attempt
that particular written test (for fear of getting negative marks).
The column named "Sel" tells whether the candidate was finally
selected after the interview: this is a binary value (1=selected,
0=not selected).</p>

<p>A non-python exercise for you is to first convert this open-office
spreadsheet into a csv (comma-separated value) text file called
marks.csv.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a python script to read the csv file and print the total
  number of candidates who appeared for selection.  You must look for
  a number as the first entry in a row, and count such rows to arrive
  at the answer.  Your program should take exactly one command-line
  argument, the input csv file.  If the wrong number of arguments are
  given, the program should exit after printing the correct usage.<br />
      What you are expected to learn: command-line arguments,
  functions, if-then-else, loops, the csv module, regular expression
  matching
  </li>
  <li>Modify the above program to store the main data (i.e. excluding
  the header rows) as a list of lists (2D array).  And then print the
  number of candidates by using "len".<br />
      What you are expected to learn: lists, list-of-lists, the len
  function
  </li>
  <li>Modify the above program to make a list of only the final
  selection (i.e. extract that column of 1's and 0's).  Use map on the list of lists to achieve this.  Then
  print the total number of selected candidates using
  the "sum" function on this list.<br />
      What you are expected to learn: using map on a list
  </li>
  <li>Modify the above program to make another 2D matrix.  This should
  consist of the rows corresponding to only the selected candidates.
  Use the filter function to achieve this.  Then print the total
  number of selected candidates by using "len" on this 2D matrix.<br />
      What you are expected to learn: using filter on a list
  </li>
  <li>Now add to the above program to make a "dictionary" or a
  "hashtable" which maps the column name to the column index.  To
  construct this index, you have to use the header row, which you can
  identify in the program as having "SNo" as the first column
  value.  The program should then loop through the dictionary to
  print the column index of each column name.<br />
      What you are expected to learn: constructing and looping through
  dictionary or hashtable structures in python
  </li>
  <li>Modify the above program to store an extra column in each row,
  which is the total marks obtained by the candidate (count "NA" as 0
  marks).  Then sort the list-of-lists by the total marks obtained by
  each candidate.  Print this sorted list onto a new file.<br />
      What you are expected to learn: sorting a list using the "sort"
  command, and using a lambda function to specify the key
  </li>
  <li>Add to the above program to create two separate 2D matrices: one
  with the top 20% of candidates (by total marks), and another with
  the bottom 40% of candidates (by total marks).  You can create these
  as sub-lists of the above sorted matrix.  For convenience, call the
  3 matrices as OverallM, top20pM, and bot40pM respectively.<br />
      What you are expected to learn: quick ways to make sub-lists
  from lists
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [3HP]:</span> Ignoring the columns with names "SNo" and "Sel", the remaining
  columns represent the various written test scores.  For each written
  test, compute the number of candidates who attempted the test.  Also
  compute the number of candidates who attempted the test, from among
  the top 10% of candidates, and among the bottom 40% of the
  candidates.  Use a "map" over OverallM, top20pM, bot40pM to achieve
  this.<br />
      What you are expected to learn: looping through dictionary,
  writing appropriate function for map
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> We now want to compute the correlation between the total marks
  and the final selection (post interview).
      <ol class="a">
	<li>First read up and refresh your memory on what correlation
  means.  In this process, you'll also read up on average, variance,
  standard deviation, and covariance.
	</li>
	<li>Write the following functions: average, variance, standard
  deviation, covariance, correlation.  Write these functions in the
  above order.  The first three will take one list as argument, while
  the last two will take two lists as argument.  Use list
  comprehensions in writing the functions (you can write each function
  in not more than 2 lines).  Use "zip" for writing the covariance
  function.<br />
	    What you are expected to learn: list comprehensions, zip
  function
	</li>
	<li>Now use the correlation function, with the appropriately
  constructed lists as arguments, to compute the correlation between
  the total marks and the final selection of the candidate
	</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
