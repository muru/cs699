The charts were created in LibreOffice Calc, then copied to LibreOffice Draw, and the exported to EPS, with these options:
Preview: TIFF
Compression: LZW encoding
Color
Version: Level 2 
With width and heights set to the values of the sample EPS files. The line widths occasionally needed adjustment within Draw.
