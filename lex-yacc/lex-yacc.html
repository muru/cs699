<h2>Lex and Yacc Exercises</h2>

<p>For each of the exercises below, you should use the file names as
given in the solution template.</p>

<p>House points for the optional questions are given once per house,
to the student who submits the earliest.</p>

<p>Some of the solutions may be available online, even in the
tutorials provided as references.  But you are advised to code them
from scratch (no cut-paste) for understanding.  Any cut-paste will be
detrimental to your learning and will affect your performance in exams
for sure.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Toy exercises to get warmed up
      <ol class="a">
	<li><b>count-lines.l</b> Write a lex file to count the number of lines in the
  input.
	</li>
	<li><b>count-lwc.l</b>Write a lex file to count the number of lines, words, and
  characters in the input.  A word is contiguous string of
  alphanumeric characters (alphabets and numbers only).  Note that
  this definition is different from that used by the 'wc' program.
	</li>
	<li><b>count-num.l</b> Write a lex file to count the number of numbers appearing
  in the input.  Count the number of integers (without a decimal)
  separately from the number of floating point numbers (with a
  decimal, and at least one digit on either side of the decimal).
	</li>
      </ol>
      <i>What you learn:</i> basic lex syntax, regular expressions in
  lex, defining symbols for regular expressions, compiling and running
  </li>
  <li><b>calc.l, calc.y</b> Write the lex file and the yacc grammar for an expression
  calculator.  You need to deal with only '+' and only
  integers.<br />
      <i>What you learn:</i> yacc syntax, using lex and yacc together
  </li>
  <li><b>calc.l, calc.y</b> (Overwrite previous files) Enhance the above by adding support for '-' (the binary
  minus).<br />
      <i>What you learn:</i> left associativity of '-'
  </li>
  <li><b>calc.l, calc.y</b> (Overwrite previous files) Enhance the above by adding support for enclosing expressions in
  parentheses '(' and ')'.<br />
      <i>What you learn:</i> your first real context free grammar
  specification in yacc
  </li>
  <li><b>calc.l, calc.y</b> (Overwrite previous files) Enhance the above by adding support for '*' and '/'.<br />
      <i>What you learn:</i> operator precedence by order of
  specification in yacc
  </li>
  <li><b>text-cleanup.l</b> Implement the text cleanup solution in the tutorial by Victor
  Eijkhout.<br />
      <i>What you learn:</i> left states and right states in lex
  parsing
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> <b>calc.l, calc.y</b> (Overwrite previous files) Add support for simple
  decimal representation floating point numbers in your calculator.
      <br />
      <i>What you learn:</i> making yylval a union of possible types.
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> <b>calc.l, calc.y</b> (Overwrite previous files) Add support for
  identifier based variables in your calculator, and assignment
  statements for and using variables.
      <br />
      <i>What you learn:</i> making yylval a union of possible types,
  maintaining a symbol table.
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> <b>ex1.l, ex1.y</b> Exercise-1 from <a
  href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~borja/cmsc16200/labs/CMSC16200_WIN07_Lab6.pdf">here</a>.<br
  />
      <i>What you learn:</i> specifying a grammar, parsing a configuration file using lex/yacc
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [3HP]:</span> <b>ex2.l, ex2.y</b> Exercise-2 from the same location.<br />
      <i>What you learn:</i> reading someone else's lex/yacc code
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [5HP]:</span> <b>ex3.l, ex3.y</b> Exercise-3 from the same location.<br />
      <i>What you learn:</i> integrating parsed configuration
  parameters into the main program
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Optional [10HP]:</span> <b>ex4.l, ex4.y</b> Exercise-4 from the same location.<br />
      <i>What you learn:</i> maintaining a symbol table as you parse
  an input file
  </li>
</ol>
