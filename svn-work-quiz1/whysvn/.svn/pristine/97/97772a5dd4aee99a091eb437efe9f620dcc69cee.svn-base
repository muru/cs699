\author{Murukesh Mohanan\\133059001}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
In this quiz, you will be generating, using latex, a PDF file which looks
similar to this PDF file having the questions. You will also be storing all your
answers in an svn repository you created for the quiz.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Question-1: 2 marks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Create a local svn repository (which will be accessed using ``file://'')
		within the directory “svn-repo-quiz1”.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Question-2: 1 mark}
		Start editing your main latex file “quiz1-answer.tex”, with the text content
		as in the questions PDF file (you can cut-paste this part). Generate the
		PDF version of the latex file as “quiz1-answer.pdf”. This answer PDF
		should be similar in content to the PDF file with the questions (exact
		locations of page breaks, exact locations of figures are not important).
		Add “quiz1-answer.pdf” into the svn repository and commit.
	\item \textbf{Question-3: 1 mark}\\
		Write the following equation in Latex.\\
		$ e^x = \sum^\infty_{i=0} \frac{x^i}{i!} $
	\item \textbf{Question-4: 2+0.5 marks}\\
	Plot the following graph using gnuplot by editing the file “cdf-plot.gnu”.
Embed it in latex as eps or pdf; the exact position of the figure is not
important. The relevant data is given in files “a1.csv” and “a2.csv”
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics{cdf-plot.eps}
\caption{CDF of the number of retransmissions}
\label{fig:cdf}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\centering
	\includegraphics[clip=true,trim=1cm 2.5cm 1cm 2.5cm,scale=1.5]{butterfly.eps}
\caption{Depiction of a symmetric network graph}
\label{fig:butterfly}
\end{figure}
\item \textbf{Question-6: 1 mark}\\
	Refer to the above graph and figure using Latex cross-reference in the
	following sentence.
	"Figure \ref{fig:cdf} is a CDF plot while Figure \ref{fig:butterfly} is a butterfly."
\end{enumerate}
