\chapter{Conclusion}
The \glspl{spe} and stable filters derived thus far 
can convert coupled equations of motion of most systems into 
decoupled differential equations, which can easily be solved. 
This part of the project can work as an accessory for applying
True Modal Control on a real-life system.

The study of stable filters thus far has just been a peek into the
space of filters and automorphic transforms. While the methods and 
results presented here can be used for obtaining stable filters 
for most systems while using True Modal Control, an analytical 
study should prove rewarding.

\section{Future research}
Aside from applying True Modal Control to a real system, there
are other avenues for academic research as well:
\begin{itemize}
\item The boundary of unreachable \glspl{cpc}, both in the 2-dimensional and 
the general $n$-dimensional case.
\item The effect of defective systems: The Jordan canonical form, and
study of loosely coupled equations that the Jordan form represents. 
Investigate whether \glspl{lam} can be defective, and if so, explore the 
conditions when this may occur.
\item Refining the Monte Carlo method to provide better results faster.
\end{itemize}
