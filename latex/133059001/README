This LaTeX file was compiled using xelatex, and has a glossary.
You need to have texlive-xetex installed for xelatex and 
texlive-latex-extra installed for the makeglossaries command.
Usage of makeglossaries is similar to that of bibtex.

The same LaTeX doc has both multicolumn and single column
areas, using the multicol package.
