to compile the program, do:

make

for a fresh run and clean files, do:

make clean.

To run the program, do:

./lo3mac
see the options and enter arguments,
e.g. ./lo3mac 0 2 >temp.dump would run the program
with 0% error rate for 2 hours.

inputFiles:

coordinateFile.txt is generated by program in GenerateGraph.
It contains coordinates of the nodes in the network.

networkGraph.txt is created by simulator program.
It is a connectivity matrix.

recordFlows.txt is either pre-created by simulator program
or can be created by simulator program during a run.
Check GENERATE_REQUESTS_FROM_FILE flag in header.h.
If it is 1, the contents f recordFlows.txt are used.
Otherwise, program generates flows and puts in recordFlows.txt
for subsequent simulator runs.

outputFiles:

results.txt contains results in terms of number of calls
originated, admitted, rejected etc.

flows:

flow* contains flow specific information, e.g.
flow request latency, number of hops in a flow
and individual data packet numbers along with the time
the packets are received at etc.

logs:

node* containts node specific information, e.g.
time at which node joined, number of packet losses etc.
