<h2>General Instructions</h2>

<ol>
  <li><span class="em">Lab machine local login:</span> If you are using a lab machine for this exam, you are supposed
  to use the <span class="em">nsluser</span> local login.  If you are
  using your CSE login or any other login, logout immediately and
  login as nsluser.  This is not applicable of course, if you are
  using a bootable USB, or your own laptop.
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Non use of nautilus windows:</span> You are supposed to be viewing this file, after a download+save,
  and a command-line tar command on the tgz.  If you have open using
  double-click window-interface file extraction, you may lose your files!
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">prepare-upload.sh:</span> For the submission, use the prepare-upload.sh file given.  Using
  any other method is not recommended.
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Upload URL:</span> The upload URL is at the same place where you downloaded the
  solution-template.  Be sure to check the md5sum of the uploaded
  forupload.tgz against what is reported after a successful upload.
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Script templates:</span> For each question, a
  script template is provided.  The beginning of this template
  specifies the question in detail.  To answer, you should edit the
  bash script template file only between the lines
  marked START and END: you should NOT edit before the START line or
  after the END line.  You will get <span class="em">-2 marks</span>
  if you edit anywhere other than the specified portion.
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Test scripts:</span> For each question, I've provided also a test script, which will
  generate one or more simple test cases for your answer script.  Note
  that these test cases are <span class="em">not necessarily
  complete</span>.  That is, you may not get full marks even if the
  test cases run successfully.  It is best to check the specification
  of each question carefully, in addition to running the test scripts.
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Supplementary files:</span> Some questions have
  supplementary files involved.  This should be clear on reading the
  question.
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">Hints:</span> Many questions carry hints.  Be
  sure to read them carefully.
  </li>
  <li><span class="em">House points:</span> Some questions carry house
  points for specific aspects of the solution.  In addition, you will
  score 5HP if you score 18 or higher, 10HP if you score the full 20
  marks.  In addition, every submission within 2 hours, and scoring at
  least 10 marks, will score 10HP.
  </li>
</ol>
