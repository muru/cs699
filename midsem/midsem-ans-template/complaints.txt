Enter the text of your complaints below, only in the space provided.
Be brief.

Also, for each complaint, provide a revised/correct script, which is a
minimal modification of your original script.  I will manually check
each modification against your original submission, and permit only
those which involve 'minor' changes (e.g. forgot a semicolon, used a
gnuplot command which works only in newer versions).

Version error, fixed by changing 'set term eps' to 'set term postscript eps'.
Presumably the other error happens when gnuplot didn't exit 
successfully, so I haven't changed anything for that.
