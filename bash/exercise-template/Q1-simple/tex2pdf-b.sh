# This program should compile the latex file given as argument, a tex
# file assumed to be in the current/working directory.  And if the
# latex compilation succeeds, it should tar-gzip the entire current
# directory (from the current directory) to a tgz file called
# paper.tgz.  It should then move the paper.tgz file to /tmp.
