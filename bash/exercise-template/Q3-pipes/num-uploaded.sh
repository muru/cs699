# Assume that you are in a directory which has several
# sub-directories, one for each student in a course.  Within
# sub-directory X, corresponding to student with roll number X, the
# file uploaded-forupload.tgz is present or absent depending on
# whether or not the student has submitted his/her bash assignment.

# Write a SINGLE LINE bash command to print the number of students who
# have submitted their assignments so far.

# Additional exercise (no HP): there are at least two ways to do this,
# find them
